## What it is

In line with our philosophy of making technology as affordable as possible, we make another addition to our collection of tools which make the use of free google tools (docs, sheets, drive, colab, etc) and free github hosting as easy as ABC even for non-technical users. While [docs2Blog](https://csymapp.github.io/docs2blog) was intended for converting google docs into blog posts for nice looking websites, Sheets2Resume will help you to generate your resume from data in a google sheet using tailwind and nuxt. You will take care of the data as we take care of the output and the formatting. If you don't like the current template, more are on the way. You may not need to learn any new tool to use sheets2resume, unless you want to host your resume on github pages. To start using it, all you need to do is to open [this colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adventHymnals/resources/blob/master/Sheets2Resume.ipynb).

See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) guide for more details.
